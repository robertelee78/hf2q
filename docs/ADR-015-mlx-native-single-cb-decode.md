# ADR-015: mlx-native — general decode-path speed improvements (qwen35 + gemma)

- **Status:** Proposed (Phase 1 single-CB hypothesis revised by P2 calibration — see Diagnosis update §2026-04-26)
- **Date:** 2026-04-26 (initial); revised same-day after P2 empirical data
- **Authors:** Robert E. Lee + Claude Code
- **Successor of:** ADR-012 §Optimize / Task #15 (closed at 0.94× of llama.cpp; cited the need for a "new mlx-native perf ADR")
- **Siblings of:** ADR-013 (qwen35 inference — owns the qwen35 forward path being rewritten); ADR-006 (mlx-native GPU backend — owns the Gemma `forward_decode` path being rewritten)
- **Standing requirement:** "as fast as our peers" applies to **every shipped model family** — `feedback_shippability_standing_directive`, restated 2026-04-26: *"we need this coherence and speed for qwen and gemma families of models"*. ADR-015 covers both.

## Context

ADR-012 closed the qwen35moe **conversion** scope at 0.94× of llama.cpp on
`dwq46` `n=256` decode (109.1 vs 116.0 t/s, M5 Max, same-day median per
`project_end_gate_reality_check`). Per-CB GPU time matches llama.cpp; the
gap is **CPU-side encoding/scheduling overhead**.

### The structural diagnosis

| Path | CBs / decode token | CPU encode overhead at ~5µs/CB |
|---|---:|---:|
| **llama.cpp** (`ggml-metal-context.m:458`) | 1–2 | ~5–10 µs |
| **hf2q Gemma** (`forward_mlx.rs:1309` — "one GraphSession per layer (30/pass)") | ~30 | ~150 µs |
| **hf2q qwen35** (95 `device.command_encoder()` call-sites in `inference/models/qwen35/`) | ~102 (measured `fa3f9d6`) | ~510 µs |

llama.cpp's own measurement: *"tests on M1 Pro and M2 Ultra using LLaMA
models, show that optimal values for n_cb are 1 or 2"* (`ggml-metal-context.m:458`).
Their `dispatch_apply` parallel-encoding mechanism (`:550`) targets
**prefill**, where `n_cb` may be larger; for decode, `n_cb=1` is fastest.

### Why prior CB-fusion attempts moved the needle by noise

`fa3f9d6` (small-scope CB fusion, FullAttn `sdpa+ops6-7` → 1 CB) recovered
~40 µs/token at +0.5% within noise — exactly the slope predicted by ~5 µs/CB:
the experiment removed 10 CBs / token. That data point **confirms the
theory** at one decimal place; it just couldn't statistically distinguish
+0.5% from zero at n=256 with 3 cold runs. Removing all ~100 CBs (going
to 1–2) projects to ~500 µs / token saved ≈ the entire 6% deficit.

### Why dispatch_apply alone isn't the lever for decode

`dispatch_apply` parallelizes encoding **across CPU threads**; CB count
**stays the same**. To recover 0.5 ms / token of encode overhead the CB
count itself has to drop by ~50× — not the encode wall-clock per CB.
The lever for decode is **single-CB forward pass**, not parallel encoding.

(Prefill is a separate axis — see Non-Goals.)

### 2026-04-26 — DIAGNOSIS UPDATE FROM P2 CALIBRATION

The working assumption above (~5 µs/CB) was a citation, not a measurement.
P2 (mlx-native `examples/cb_cost_calibration.rs`) measured it directly on
M5 Max:

| N    | regime     | wall_ms (median of 5) | µs/CB |
|-----:|:-----------|----------------------:|------:|
|   10 | async      |                 0.056 |  5.61 |
|   10 | sync       |                 0.154 | 15.39 |
|   10 | alloc+cmit |                 0.041 |  4.05 |
|  100 | async      |                 0.174 |  1.74 |
|  100 | sync       |                 1.694 | 16.94 |
|  100 | alloc+cmit |                 0.179 |  1.79 |
|  500 | async      |                 0.858 |  1.72 |
|  500 | sync       |                 6.688 | 13.38 |
|  500 | alloc+cmit |                 0.826 |  1.65 |
| 1000 | async      |                 1.583 |  1.58 |
| 1000 | sync       |                13.484 | 13.48 |
| 1000 | alloc+cmit |                 1.617 |  1.62 |

The **production hot path is `async`** (`enc.commit()` per layer, single
terminal `commit_and_wait` for argmax download).  Steady-state
**async µs/CB ≈ 1.6 µs** at N≥100 — **3.1× lower than the working
assumption**.

**Re-derived budget for hf2q qwen35 decode:**

| Component | CBs | µs/CB | total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| hf2q qwen35 (102 CBs) | 102 | 1.6 | **163 µs** |
| llama.cpp (1–2 CBs) | 1.5 | 1.6 | **2 µs** |
| **CB-overhead gap** | | | **~160 µs** |

Measured hf2q→llama.cpp gap = **~500 µs / token** (`fa3f9d6` /
ADR-012 §Optimize).  CB-count alone explains **~32%** of the gap, not the
~100% the original 5 µs/CB working assumption implied.

**Implication: single-CB rewrite is necessary but insufficient.**  Even a
perfect 102→1 CB collapse leaves ~340 µs / token (~68% of the gap)
unexplained.  The remaining cost likely lives in **per-dispatch
encoding** (hf2q decode issues ~1070 dispatches/token vs llama.cpp's
similar count, but with a different per-dispatch cost profile) and/or
**Rust-side orchestration overhead** (helper-function indirection,
buffer-pool acquisition, barrier bookkeeping).

ADR-015 phasing is updated below: **P3a** measures per-dispatch cost
directly before P3 commits to the single-CB rewrite, so the upper bound
on the rewrite's win is established empirically before multi-day
implementation work is spent.

### 2026-04-26 — P3a CALIBRATION DATA

`mlx-native/examples/dispatch_cost_calibration.rs` measures per-dispatch
encode cost using `scalar_mul_bf16` on a 1-element BF16 buffer (minimal
GPU work; CPU encoding cost dominates):

| N        | encode_ms (med of 5) | commit_ms (med of 5) | µs/dispatch |
|---------:|---------------------:|---------------------:|------------:|
|       10 |                0.006 |                0.189 |       0.629 |
|       50 |                0.012 |                0.589 |       0.249 |
|      100 |                0.018 |                0.198 |       0.185 |
|      500 |                0.084 |                0.345 |       0.168 |
|     1000 |                0.163 |                0.515 |       0.163 |
|     5000 |                0.784 |                1.575 |       0.157 |

**Steady-state µs/dispatch ≈ 0.16 µs** at N≥500 — within ±15% of
llama.cpp's implied ~0.14 µs / dispatch (per ADR-012 §Optimize ~150 µs
CPU encode for ~1070 dispatches).  hf2q's shader-launch path is **not
materially slower** than llama.cpp's.

### Budget reconciliation (P2 + P3a synthesized)

| Component | hf2q | llama.cpp | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **GPU work** (per ADR-012 §Optimize) | 8.45 ms | 8.38 ms | **+70 µs** |
| **CPU CB encode** (102 vs 1.5 CBs × 1.6 µs/CB) | 163 µs | 2 µs | **+161 µs** |
| **CPU dispatch encode** (~1070 dispatches × 0.16 vs 0.14 µs) | 171 µs | 150 µs | **+21 µs** |
| **Sub-total accountable** | | | **+252 µs** |
| **Measured wall delta** (1/109.1 − 1/116.0 t/s) | 9.16 ms | 8.62 ms | **+540 µs** |
| **Residual unaccounted** | | | **+288 µs** |

**The biggest single lever is the residual ~288 µs (~53% of gap)**, not
the CB-encode delta (~30%).  The residual cannot be CB or dispatch
encoding — both are now measured.  Suspects (in priority order):

1. **Helper-function indirection** — every `apply_*` helper in
   `inference/models/qwen35/` does multiple short-lived allocations
   (`MlxBuffer` for params, scratch shapes) and Result wrapping.  ~95
   helpers per token × Rust function-prologue cost is plausibly
   double-digit µs each.
2. **Buffer pool acquisition** — `pooled_alloc_buffer` calls walk the
   in-use list and bucket size on every call.
3. **Memory barrier bookkeeping** — `enc.memory_barrier()` mutates
   `pending_reads`/`pending_writes` Vecs (capture mode + RAW/WAR
   tracking).
4. **KV-cache cursor updates** — `slot.current_len[0] += 1` per
   FullAttn / DeltaNet layer with the associated buffer fence.

The **lever for closing the residual** is a Rust-orchestration sweep
(profile guided), not architecture.  Single-CB still helps because it
removes 100 of the encoder lifetimes plus barrier-bookkeeping
state-machine transitions, but the orchestration sweep is the bigger
chunk.

### Phase plan implication

Original P3 (qwen35 single-CB rewrite) recovers ~30% of the gap.
**A new P3b (Rust-orchestration profiling sweep) is added** that targets
the ~53% residual.  P3 and P3b can run in parallel; the P5 bench gate
requires both wins to clear ≥1.00× of llama.cpp.

## Decision

**D1.** Migrate **both** `qwen35` and `gemma` decode forward paths to a
**single `GraphSession`** (1 CB per forward pass), mirroring llama.cpp's
`encode_async` (`ggml-metal-context.m:676–722`) — one logical command
buffer encoded with explicit `encoder.memory_barrier()` between dependent
op stages.  Order: `qwen35` first (proves the pattern on the harder MoE
+ DeltaNet shape), `gemma` second (port the established pattern to the
dense-only path).

**D2.** Keep the existing per-layer-encoder paths as the legacy
implementation behind a single env var `HF2Q_LEGACY_PER_LAYER_CB=1` (covers
both families).  After a 7-day soak + sourdough-pass on each family's new
path, delete the legacy path for that family entirely (per
`feedback_no_broken_windows`).

**D3.** Bit-exact parity gate vs the current decode entry points is
mandatory **per family** (within 1e-5 max-abs logit error on each
family's smoke set).  No fallback path is shipped — if parity fails, the
lever is wrong; fix it, don't gate the primary path off (per
`feedback_never_ship_fallback_without_rootcause`).

**D4.** Exit criteria — **both** families must clear the bar:
  - **qwen35:** `dwq46` `n=256` decode median **≥ 1.00× of llama.cpp**
    same-day median (3 cold runs each, M5 Max, cold SoC per
    `feedback_perf_gate_thermal_methodology`).  Reference baseline from
    ADR-012 closure: hf2q 109.1 t/s vs llama.cpp 116.0 t/s = **0.94×**.
  - **gemma:** `gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-ara-abliterated-dwq` `n=256` decode
    median **≥ 1.00× of llama.cpp** same-day median (same methodology).
    Reference baseline must be re-measured at P0 (no committed value
    on file as of 2026-04-26 — see Open Question Q1).

## Phasing

| Phase | Deliverable | Definition of done |
|---|---|---|
| **P0 — Gemma baseline** | Same-day `gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-ara-abliterated-dwq` `n=256` decode median: 3 cold runs of `hf2q` + 3 of `llama-bench`. Establishes the gemma-side ratio. | Numbers recorded in this ADR as the baseline gemma-family bar. |
| **P1 — Audit** | Map every cross-CB synchronization point in `forward_gpu` (qwen35) and `forward_decode` (Gemma) paths. List of `(commit/commit_and_wait → next encoder)` transitions and the buffer dependencies that justify each one. Output: a markdown table per family in this ADR. | Every CB boundary in each family's live path is annotated with the data dependency it protects, OR documented as legacy / removable. |
| **P2 — Empty-CB cost calibration** | ✅ **Done 2026-04-26** — `mlx-native/examples/cb_cost_calibration.rs` measures async/sync/alloc-only µs/CB on M5 Max.  Result: **async µs/CB ≈ 1.6 µs at N≥100, NOT ~5 µs**.  Single-CB upper bound = ~160 µs / token of the ~500 µs gap (~32%). | Numbers published in §Diagnosis update above. |
| **P3a — Per-dispatch cost calibration** | ✅ **Done 2026-04-26** — `mlx-native/examples/dispatch_cost_calibration.rs` measures `scalar_mul_bf16` encode cost.  Result: **µs/dispatch ≈ 0.16 µs** at N≥500, within ±15% of llama.cpp's implied 0.14 µs/dispatch.  Shader-launch path is competitive; lever is Rust orchestration. | Numbers published in §P3a calibration data above. |
| **P3 — Single-CB rewrite** (qwen35 first, gemma second) | New `forward_gpu_single_cb` in `inference/models/qwen35/forward_gpu.rs` and `forward_decode_single_cb` in `serve/forward_mlx.rs`.  Each: one `GraphSession`, all dispatches encoded, explicit `memory_barrier()` for cross-stage dependencies, single `commit()` at end. | Builds in release.  No new `unsafe`.  Recovers ~30% of the 540 µs gap (~161 µs). |
| **P3b — Rust orchestration sweep** ⬅ **NEW (parallel to P3)** | Profile-guided reduction of the ~288 µs residual from helper-function indirection, buffer pool acquisition, barrier bookkeeping, KV-cursor updates.  Use `cargo flamegraph` or `instruments -t TimeProfiler` on a hot decode loop.  Target: shrink the residual by ≥50% (~140 µs). | At least 5 profile-driven specific reductions landed (each cited with profile evidence in the commit message).  Combined with P3, restores ≥0.99× ratio (one cold-run iteration). |
| **P5 — Parity gate (per family)** | 16-prompt smoke on each family's new path produces logits within 1e-5 max-abs of legacy path. | Logged in commit message. |
| **P6 — Bench gate (per family)** | 3 cold runs of `hf2q --benchmark` on `dwq46` and `gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-ara-abliterated-dwq` at `n=256` (cold SoC).  Same-day `llama-bench -p 0 -n 256 -r 3` on the same model.  Ratio computed per family. | Ratio ≥ 1.00× recorded for **both** families in ADR + commit message. |
| **P7 — Default cut-over** | `HF2Q_LEGACY_PER_LAYER_CB=1` is the only way back to legacy.  Default = single-CB on both families. | Smoke + bench gate green on default-default settings. |
| **P8 — Soak + delete legacy** | 7-day window, no regressions.  Then delete `forward_gpu_greedy` (qwen35 legacy) and the per-layer-GraphSession Gemma legacy entirely. | Diff-stat ≥ 1000 LOC removed across both families. |

## Open questions / risks

| ID | Risk / open question | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **R1** | Barrier correctness: single-CB requires every cross-stage dependency expressed as `enc.memory_barrier()`. A missed barrier = silent corruption. | P4 bit-exact parity gate is mandatory. Spot-check with `mlx_native::ops::memory_barrier` debug logging during P3. |
| **R2** | Encoder lifetime + buffer pool: a long-lived encoder may hold buffer refs across the full forward pass, blocking pool reuse and inflating peak working set. | P3 measures pool stats; if `pool.alloc_count` > pre-ADR + 10%, size the pool up or refactor to release. |
| **R3** | `MLX_PROFILE_CB` per-label timing relies on CB granularity. With 1 CB / token, per-stage attribution is gone. | Switch to per-dispatch labels (`commit_labeled` becomes `dispatch_labeled` — already partially supported). Document the change in the P3 commit. |
| **R4** | The 6% gap may not be 100% encode overhead. If P2 shows µs/CB << 5, single-CB wins shrink. | P2 is the cost calibration. If the upper bound drops below ~3% headroom, re-scope to a different lever (Option B below) before P3. |
| **R5** | MoE expert dispatch is the largest contributor to dispatch count (256 experts × N selected per layer). Single-CB doesn't compress dispatch count, only CB count. If dispatch overhead dominates encode cost, single-CB still wins (one `commit` not 100), but the CPU encode cost itself doesn't shrink. | P2 also measures per-dispatch encode cost (encode N noop dispatches into 1 CB). If per-dispatch dominates, the lever is fewer dispatches, not fewer CBs — branch to a separate ADR (e.g., persistent-MoE-router or shader-side expert loop). |
| **R6** | Decode-only pivot: prefill is unchanged. Long-prefill parity inversion (`project_long_prefill_parity_inverts`) remains open. | Out of scope for ADR-015 — covered by Non-Goal 1. |

## Non-goals

1. **Prefill parity** — `pp≥1024` parity inversion at `-ub 512` matched batching is a separate axis, owned by a future ADR. ADR-015 measures decode only.
2. **Speculative / MTP decode** — ADR-013 P14 territory.
3. **Sampler upgrades beyond greedy** — ADR-008 placement decision stands; sampling lives in hf2q `sampler_pure.rs`.

## Alternatives considered

- **Option A: dispatch_apply parallel encoding (`/opt/llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-metal/ggml-metal-context.m:550`).** *Rejected for decode* — llama.cpp's own data shows `n_cb=1` is optimal for decode (`:458`). dispatch_apply is a prefill mechanism. Would still help our prefill — but per Non-Goal 1, that's a separate ADR. Not committed in this iteration.
- **Option B: cross-token speculative pipelining (draft + verify decode).** *Deferred* — substantial program-structure change. Becomes attractive only if Option A (single-CB) hits the wall before 1.00×. Land in a successor ADR if needed.
- **Option C: source-level kernel fusion (combine adjacent compute kernels into one shader).** *Falsified 9× in the M5 Max static-evidence kernel-hypothesis register* — most recent: `swiglu` Q4_0 `mv_id` (mlx-native@`4efeec0`, hf2q@`502364d`, −1.5%). The Metal compiler hoists what llama.cpp hand-tunes (`project_metal_compiler_auto_optimizes_static_levers`). Not a productive lever on M5 Max for current workloads.
- **Option D: keep status quo at 0.94×.** *Rejected.* Per `feedback_shippability_standing_directive` and `feedback_no_shortcuts`, "as fast as our peers" is the standing exit bar. 0.94× is not shippable.

## Changelog

- **2026-04-26 — Proposed (initial).** Diagnosis pivot from ADR-012 §Optimize: gap is CB-count, not CB-encode-time. Single-CB forward pass selected over `dispatch_apply` based on llama.cpp's own n_cb data.
- **2026-04-26 — Title broadened to "general decode-path speed improvements" + scope extended to gemma family** per standing directive *"we need this coherence and speed for qwen and gemma families of models"*.
- **2026-04-26 — P2 calibration empirical:** `async µs/CB ≈ 1.6 µs` (3.1× lower than working assumption).  Single-CB recovers ~32% of the 500 µs gap, not ~100%.  Plan revised: P3a per-dispatch cost calibration inserted before P3; P4 added as a second-lever phase whose target is determined by P3a.  Title kept "single-CB" because that's still the first lever; scope is honestly "general decode speed improvements" with the single-CB rewrite as Phase 1 of N.
- **2026-04-26 — P3a calibration empirical:** `µs/dispatch ≈ 0.16 µs` at N≥500 — within ±15% of llama.cpp's ~0.14 µs/dispatch.  Shader-launch path is **not** materially slower.  Budget reconciliation: ~252 µs of the 540 µs gap is encode-time (CB + dispatch); ~288 µs (~53%) is **residual unaccounted** that lives in Rust-side orchestration.  P3b (Rust orchestration sweep) added as parallel phase to P3 single-CB rewrite.  Together P3 + P3b target ≥1.00× exit criteria.
