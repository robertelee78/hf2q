# ADR-028: Peer-Class Inference — Coherence Parity + Speed Parity-or-Better

- **Status**: proposed
- **Date**: 2026-05-09
- **Deciders**: Robert (operator), Claude (this session)
- **Tags**: performance, kernel-parity, gemma, qwen35, prefill, decode, lock-in

## Mantra (load-bearing — operator-stated 2026-05-09 iter-86)

> *"We need to be as coherent as peers, and as fast as or faster than peers."*

Coherence = byte-identical (or operator-equivalent) decoded output vs the
reference peer (`/opt/llama.cpp` HEAD `d05fe1d7d`/build 9010) on the same
GGUF, same prompt, same sampler. Speed = tok/s on the same hardware
(Apple M5 Max), measured via `llama-bench` for the peer baseline and
`hf2q generate ... --max-tokens N` for hf2q.

## Context

### What this ADR is for

Capture the cross-cutting **inference speed-gap closure workstream**
(iter-59..iter-86, 2026-05-09 session) that was previously scattered
across:
- `ADR-010-exact-batched-kernel-parity.md` §Status Log (20+ entries)
- `ADR-022-kernel-coverage-parity-with-llama-cpp.md` §5 mm_id row
- `project_gemma_prefill_bitrot_2026_05_09.md` cross-session memory

The ADR-010 §Status Log was originally for the L6 MoE router top-K
sensitivity investigation; iter-59..86 grew out of an operator-flagged
"speed gap problem we have with gemma" and produced surgical fixes,
re-profiling, lock-in gates, and a banner UX bug fix that warrant their
own coherent narrative.

### Operator-flagged starting state (2026-05-09 iter-59)

Operator: *"are you sure we have correct test? ... is all of adr-027 done?
Did you forget about the speed gap problem we have with gemma?"*

Direct re-bench at HEAD on `gemma4-ara-2pass-APEX-Q5_K_M.gguf` (Q6_K
dominant, 19.16 GiB, M5 Max):

| pp   | hf2q per-token (default) | llama.cpp peer | gap |
|------|-------------------------:|---------------:|----:|
| 128  |   65 t/s                 |  1715 t/s      | **0.038× = 26.6× SLOWER** |
| 512  |   67 t/s                 |  2576 t/s      | **0.026× = 38.4× SLOWER** |
| 1024 |   67 t/s                 |  1884 t/s      | **0.036× = 27.7× SLOWER** |

Documented memory had cited "0.40× prefill" but that was qwen35-specific.
Gemma's user-default was much worse. The fast-path (batched prefill)
existed, was peer-competitive at 0.90× on Apr 20 (commit `9091b8c`), but
had bit-rotted: HEAD produced gibberish (`41211789...`) on a 27-token
"What is 2+2?" prompt because the leg_hb_encoded buffer was never written.

### Investigation chain (iter-59..63)

1. **iter-59**: Measured the actual gap (above). Gap is in user-default
   per-token prefill path, not the gated batched path.
2. **iter-60..62**: `git bisect` aborted after 24 SKIPS due to
   mlx-native API drift between Apr 20 and HEAD; bug-pattern (correct
   first decode token + corrupted subsequent tokens) localized to KV-cache
   write rather than prefill compute.
3. **iter-63 SMOKING GUN**: Direct code-read of
   `forward_prefill_batched.rs` at HEAD revealed NO TQ/HB encode calls
   anywhere. Per-token `forward_prefill.rs` does TWO things batched
   doesn't: (a) eagerly allocates `self.leg_hb_encoded` at lines 815-852,
   (b) HB-encodes K/V per token at lines 1234-1272. Decode reads from
   `leg_hb_encoded` via `flash_attn_vec_tq_hb` → reads zero-init bytes →
   garbage attention → gibberish tokens.

## Decision

This ADR **records and pulls together** the iter-64..86 implementation +
lock-in chain as the canonical reference for the peer-parity workstream.
The fixes and lock-in gates are already LANDED on origin/main; this ADR
creates a single-document narrative.

### Fix #1 — iter-64 (hf2q `133722d`, +91 LOC)

In `src/serve/forward_prefill_batched.rs`, mirror per-token's
HB-encode flow:

1. **Eager allocation** of `self.leg_hb_encoded` near line 297, gated on
   `tq_codebook_bits_prefill >= 5` (default 8). Mirrors
   `forward_prefill.rs:815-852`.
2. **Per-layer HB encode block** in the layer loop, immediately after
   the dense KV copy at line 1327. Calls `mlx_native::ops::
   hadamard_quantize_kv::dispatch_hadamard_quantize_kv_hb_seq` for K
   (`pf_k_normed`) and V (`pf_v_normed`) over all `seq_len` positions
   using the SAME `dst_seq_pos_start` / `n_copy` / `src_tok_offset` as
   the dense copy. Mirrors `forward_prefill.rs:1234-1272`.

### Fix #2 — iter-68 (mlx-native `b6b8e79`, 1 character)

In `src/shaders/quantized_matmul_id_mm_tensor.metal:447`, change
`GgmlMatmulIdMm_TensorParams` → `GgmlMatmulIdMmTensor_MmParams`. The
typo caused the entire `.metal` source to fail Metal compile, which
made the runtime probe `probe_tensor_mm_id` return false, falling back
to the slower simdgroup MMA variant for ALL K-quant mm_id pipelines
(Q4_0, Q8_0, Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, Q5_1, IQ4_NL).

### Lock-in chain (iter-65, 73, 74, 75, 77, 78, 80)

Four-layer regression-gate stack chained into a single operator
command: `bash scripts/adr010_iter64_iter68_full_lock.sh` (~1 min):

1. **`mlx-native/tests/test_all_shaders_compile.rs`** (iter-73,
   ~86 LOC): every `.metal` source compiles via `xcrun metal -c`. Catches
   iter-68-style silent typos at test time.
2. **`scripts/adr010_iter64_batched_coherence_gate.sh`** (iter-65/74/75/77/80,
   5 steps): per-token reference truth, batched coherence (contains "4",
   no 6+ digit run), STRICT byte-identity per-token vs batched, pp1024
   batched perf-floor (≥1500 t/s, median-of-3), gemma decode-throughput
   floor (≥50 t/s, median-of-3).
3. **qwen35 cross-model perf-floor** (iter-78): pp512 prefill ≥1800 t/s,
   median-of-3.
4. **iter-76 single-command runner** chains all the above.

### Banner UX fix — iter-82 (hf2q `469725a`)

`Gemma4Config::full_attention_interval()` helper detects "every Nth
layer is Full" pattern from `layer_types`. Used at engine.rs:2177.
Pre-fix banner: `full_attn_every=none` (misleading); post-fix:
`full_attn_every=6` (correct — 5 of 30 gemma layers are Full).

## Validation

### Combined speedup (iter-64+iter-68 on Gemma-4 batched prefill)

| pp | per-token (default) | batched (post-fix) | llama.cpp | speedup vs default | vs peer |
|---:|--------------------:|-------------------:|----------:|-------------------:|--------:|
| 128 |   65 t/s            |    609 t/s         |   1715 t/s |    9.4×           | 0.36×   |
| 512 |   67 t/s            |   1477 t/s         |   2576 t/s |   22×             | 0.57×   |
| **1024** | 67 t/s         |  **1942 t/s**      |   1884 t/s | **29×**           | **1.03× — BEATS llama** |
| 2455 |  67 t/s            |   2329 t/s         |   3023 t/s |   35×             | 0.77×   |

### Cross-model validation (iter-78)

qwen35moe pp512: hf2q 2300 t/s vs llama.cpp 2921 t/s = **0.79× peer**.
qwen35 uses its own code path but routes through the same shared
`mm_id_pooled` dispatcher → iter-68 typo fix benefits qwen35 too.

### User-visible E2E impact (iter-79)

Real chat prompt (52-tok instruction + 80-tok output):

| Path | Prefill TTFT | Decode | Total turn |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Per-token (DEFAULT) | 915 ms | 1260 ms | **2.18 s** |
| Batched (gated) | 214 ms | 1260 ms | **1.47 s** |

**TTFT 4.3× faster (701 ms saved/turn). Total chat turn 33% faster.**
First decode token id=8409 byte-identical across runs.

### Iter-86 post-fix profile re-measurement

| Bucket | iter-66 (pre-fix) | iter-86 (post-fix) | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| MOE_GATE_UP | 542 ms (34.5%) | **210 ms (18.0%)** | **-61%** |
| MOE_DOWN | 298 ms (18.9%) | 186 ms (16.0%) | -37% |
| MoE total | 53.4% | 34.0% | -53% |
| TOTAL | 1574 ms | **1165 ms** | **-26%** |
| Throughput pp2455 | 1737 t/s | **2119 t/s** | +22% |
| **vs llama.cpp peer** | 0.57× | **0.70×** | **+13pp** |

### Decode investigation (iter-69..72, 81)

- hf2q decode = 64 t/s vs llama.cpp 103 t/s = **0.62× peer**
- ~10% decay 32→1000 tok context (KV reads grow linearly on Full layers)
- 528 dispatches/token at ~30 µs/dispatch each (dispatch-floor bound)
- iter-71 confirmed dispatch count is at parity with llama.cpp; gap is
  per-kernel-time, not graph fusion
- iter-72 `HF2Q_DUAL_BUFFER` sweep: default split=3 already optimal
- **Decode gap is structural** — no 1-line fix; multi-day µbench scope

### Iter-83 ground-state validation

hf2q full unit-test suite: **3390 passed; 0 failed; 10 ignored** (peer
WIP stashed). Lock-in chain (iter-76 single-command) PASSES at HEAD.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **User-visible win**: 29× prefill speedup over per-token default at
  pp1024; hf2q BEATS llama.cpp at this size on Gemma-4. 4.3× TTFT
  improvement on real chat prompts.
- **Cross-model benefit**: same iter-68 typo fix unlocks qwen35moe too
  (different code path, same shared dispatcher).
- **Lock-in chain prevents recurrence**: 4-layer gate stack catches
  - functional regressions (gibberish output)
  - silent shader-compile failures (iter-68-style)
  - byte-divergence between per-token and batched
  - perf regressions (>25% drop in prefill or decode)
- **Banner UX bug closed**: operators now see correct architecture info
- **Stale doc cleanup**: `mod.rs:1173-1175` "until parity validated"
  comment now accurately reflects iter-65/74/79 validations

### Negative

- **Default flag remains gated** behind `HF2Q_BATCHED_PREFILL=1 +
  HF2Q_UNSAFE_EXPERIMENTS=1` because of the L6 MoE router top-K
  threshold sensitivity at long-sequence sliding_wrap fixtures
  (operator-signed deferral 2026-04-16 ADR-010). Users must opt in to
  get the speedup.
- **Decode 0.62× peer remains**: iter-69..72/81 measured but did not
  close. Multi-day µbench infrastructure (Q6_K pack helper that doesn't
  exist) is required for kernel-level attack.
- **Pp2455 prefill still 0.70× peer** (was 0.57×). Closing further
  requires distributed work across MoE/QKV/MLP/FA kernels — no single
  bottleneck.

### Neutral

- **Doc-vs-reality cleanup**: iter-82 fixed the load banner; iter-85
  fixed the comment. Both no-behavior-change improvements that improve
  operator clarity.
- **No new public API**: all changes are internal (forward_prefill_
  batched.rs body + Metal shader text + LoadInfo computation).

## Open scope (gated on operator pick)

1. **Default-flip on batched prefill** — operator UX call. Validated for
   short-to-medium prompts (≤80 tokens) per iter-65/74. The ADR-010 L6
   MoE deferral applies only to long sliding_wrap fixtures.
2. **L6 MoE router exact alignment** (multi-week per ADR-010 §1) —
   would unlock unconditional default-on. Pre-MoE chain alignment at
   ~1e-5 level is "scope decision for this phase, not universal claim"
   per ADR-010 2026-04-16.
3. **Decode µbench infrastructure** (multi-day) — needs Q6_K pack
   helper + per-kernel timing harness. Would close 0.62× → ~0.85×
   peer estimate.
4. **Kernel fusion sweep for decode** — read llama.cpp's mv_id_q*_n_*
   family for any unported fused variants.
5. **Pp2455 closer-to-peer attack** — distributed work across 4-5
   kernel categories; estimated 30% remaining gap closure.
